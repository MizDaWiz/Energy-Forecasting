# Energy-Forecasting

This was a regression task for forecasting the Energy Production from a dataset which had the hourly production for 2 sources of energy. It was a task to be completed in 1 day so the code is a little scrappy and I've documented my findings [here](https://trusting-team-b5f.notion.site/Energy-Production-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-10a69aa80359800a9958cdb6406180e3?pvs=4)
