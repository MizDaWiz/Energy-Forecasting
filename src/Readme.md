# Source Code

## Cleaning
This file checks for duplicates and null values and performs encoding for categorical features

## EDA
This file helps visualize the data and look for any improvements we can make before we train on the dataset

## Baseline Models
We train some standard machine learning models to get a baseline for model performance

## LSTM 
We implement an LSTM for our prediction tasks to get the best model performance
